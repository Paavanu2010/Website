<h2> ABOUT US </h2>
<p>Since 1944, Bal Bharati Public School has championed the cause of nourishing our rich culture, heritage and tradition while maintaining a progressive 
attitude towards the future needs, fostering academic rigour with a caring heart, and appreciating individuals with the warmth of a cohesive school community. 
Today, in a world where society is increasingly fragmented and polarized, our school remains a community where honesty and integrity matter, sincerity and 
hard work are equally important values, and where the process of education is as important as the grades.
<br>
<br>
Central to our efforts to build an intellectual community is our dedicated faculty. Intensely devoted to the success of their students, the faculty serves as
teachers, coaches, advisors, mentors and friends. In every area of school life, the faculty seeks to challenge and inspire students to reach new levels of 
enquiry and understanding.
<br>
<br>
We are a school community of high expectations, academic and otherwise. At the same time, we are devoted to helping students develop intellectual, artistic, 
and personal interests contributing to holistic growth of each individual. Provision of all modern facilities, well planned activities and a structured 
teaching approach makes learning a fun-filled process.
<br<
<br>
The success of our school can be attributed to our ability to continually identify and respond to the changing demands across the dynamic education sector, 
as evidenced in the prestigious seals of excellence received by us over the past many years. Our success lies with our students as well, as they continue to 
enhance our reputation and make a positive impact on todayâ€™s global demands. Our very committed parent body also upholds our common ideals and aspirations as
we create a challenging and enriching educational experience for our students.<p>

        <p>Our philosophy of education has always been meeting the needs of the individual child. Children acquire skills and knowledge easily if we make the
        surroundings stimulating and purposeful. In the 21st century, the digital revolution has affected us all. Quite simply, it is changing everything: a 
        brilliant barrage of information, entertainment, companionship and education is speedily available. In this era of cut throat competition, it is of 
        paramount importance to impart an integrated education to the future citizens of the nation for successfully facing challenges. Bal Bharati Public 
        School, therefore, lays special emphasis on life skill activities, providing students an edge over others to be leaders in their respective field 
        of activity. Through life skills programme, the school aims to develop a cadre of empowered, educated and healthy adolescents, capable of making 
        decisions in life.
        In addition, students are encouraged to take advantage of the many resources available to them- their teachers, the library, the computer labs, 
        and the technology enabled smart classes. Our sports facilities provide our students the launching pad to hone their talents and make a mark in a 
        variety of sport disciplines.
